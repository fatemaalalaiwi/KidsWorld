# 🏰 Kids World


**Kids World** is a web application designed for **indoor playgrounds**, helping to organize and manage kids’ play stations more efficiently.  
Instead of the traditional manual process where kids and their information are written down on paper, this system provides a **digital solution** to register children, manage play sessions, and monitor activities in a structured and safe environment.  

The project is built with **Django**.
